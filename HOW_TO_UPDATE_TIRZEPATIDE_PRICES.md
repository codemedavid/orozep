# 🎯 Quick Guide: Update Tirzepatide Prices

## The Issue You Reported
"Admin dashboard is not updating the price in the website specifically the tirzepatide"

## ✅ SOLVED! Here's Why & How to Fix It:

---

## 🔍 What Was Happening

Your Tirzepatide products have **SIZE VARIATIONS** (different dosage sizes).

When a product has variations, the system works like this:

```
❌ Base Price (₱2,500) → NOT shown to customers
✅ Variation Price (₱8,500) → THIS is what customers see!
```

**You were updating the wrong price!** 🤦

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Always Check the "Sizes" Column First!

"No sizes" → Edit base price (blue icon)
"1 size" or more → Edit variations (purple icon)
```

### Remember the Colors:

- 🔵 **Blue (Edit)** = Edit main product info
- 🔴 **Red (Delete)** = Delete product

### Quick Test:
Want to know what customers see?
1. Go to the Products list
2. Look at the "Sizes" column
3. If it says anything other than "No sizes", click the purple icon!

---

## 📞 Still Confused?

### Check These:
1. **Are you clicking the right icon?**
   - Purple Layers = YES ✅
   - Blue Edit = NO ❌

2. **Did you save your changes?**
   - Click "Save Changes" button
   - Wait for confirmation

3. **Did you refresh the website?**
   - Press Ctrl+F5 (Windows)
   - Press Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)

### Verify Your Changes:

node check-prices.js

## 🎓 Understanding the System

### Product Structure:
```
Product (Tirzepatide 15mg)
  ├─ Base Price: ₱2,500          ← Fallback price (not used here)
  └─ Variations (Sizes):
      └─ 15mg Vial: ₱8,500        ← ACTUAL price customers see
```

### Why Variations?
- Allows multiple sizes for the same product
- Each size can have its own price
- Customers choose the size they want
- More flexible than single-price products

### When to Use What:
```
SINGLE SIZE PRODUCT (e.g., Test Kit)
→ Edit base price directly (blue edit icon)

MULTIPLE SIZE PRODUCT (e.g., Tirzepatide 5mg, 10mg, 15mg)
→ Use variations (purple layers icon)
```

## ✅ Verification Steps

After updating prices:

1. ✅ Check admin - variation price updated?
2. ✅ Refresh website - new price showing?
3. ✅ Add to cart - correct price in cart?
4. ✅ Checkout preview - right total?

All YES? **Perfect!** 🎉
