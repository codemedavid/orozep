# 🔧 Troubleshooting: Prices Not Updating

## Quick Diagnostic Steps

### Step 1: Open Browser Console
1. Open your website (`http://localhost:5173`)
2. Press **F12** (or Right-click → Inspect)
3. Click the **Console** tab
4. Look for these messages:

**✅ GOOD - Real-time is working:**
```
🔄 Fetching products from database...
📦 Found 12 products
  └─ Tirzepatide 15mg: 1 variations, prices: 15mg Vial:₱8500
📡 Real-time subscription status: SUBSCRIBED
```

**❌ BAD - Real-time is NOT working:**
```
📡 Real-time subscription status: CHANNEL_ERROR
or
No subscription messages at all
```

### Step 2: Test Real-time Connection

Open this file in your browser:
```
/Users/ynadonaire/Desktop/orozep-ph/REALTIME_DIAGNOSTIC.html
```

This will test if Supabase Real-time is enabled.

### Step 3: Enable Real-time in Supabase (MOST COMMON ISSUE!)

**This is probably your issue!** Real-time is NOT enabled by default.

1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your **orozep-ph** project
3. Click **Database** in sidebar
4. Click **Replication** (or **Publications** in older versions)
5. Find these tables and **ENABLE** them:
   - ✅ `products`
   - ✅ `product_variations`
6. **IMPORTANT:** Wait 30-60 seconds for changes to apply
7. Refresh your website
8. Check console again - should now say `SUBSCRIBED`

### Step 4: Verify Database Was Actually Updated

1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Click **Table Editor**
3. Select `product_variations` table
4. Find the variation you edited
5. **Check if the price actually changed in the database**
   - If YES → Real-time issue (see Step 3)
   - If NO → The update didn't save (see Step 5)

### Step 5: Verify Update Saved Successfully

When you edit a variation in admin:
1. Look for **"Variation updated successfully!"** alert
2. If you don't see this, check console for errors
3. Try editing again and watch the console

### Step 6: Manual Refresh Test

1. Open your website
2. Note a product's current price
3. Go to admin dashboard
4. Edit that product's variation price
5. Save changes
6. Go back to website tab
7. Press **Cmd+Shift+R** (Mac) or **Ctrl+Shift+R** (Windows) for hard refresh
8. Check if price changed
   - If YES → Real-time issue (enable it in Supabase)
   - If NO → Database update issue (check Supabase dashboard)

## If Still Not Working

### Run the Diagnostic Tool:

# Open this file in your browser:
open /Users/ynadonaire/Desktop/orozep-ph/REALTIME_DIAGNOSTIC.html
```

This will show you exactly what's wrong.

### Check Supabase Status:

Visit: https://status.supabase.com

Make sure all services are operational.

### Enable Real-time via SQL (Alternative):

2. Run this query:

```sql
-- Enable real-time for products table
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE products;

-- Enable real-time for product_variations table
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE product_variations;
```

3. Wait 60 seconds
4. Test again
